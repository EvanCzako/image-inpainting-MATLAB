# image-inpainting-MATLAB
Uses LaPlace equation to fill holes in images smoothly, including edges and corners.

Extension of algorithm described by Steve Eddins in the following article: https://blogs.mathworks.com/steve/2015/06/17/region-filling-and-laplaces-equation/ 
Modified code to make it usable on images with holes lying on their edges or corners. Accomplishes same task as regionfill function of MATLAB's Image Processing Toolbox.
See function description for more details and example of use.
